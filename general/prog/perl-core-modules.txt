This is an attempt to make it easier to determine dependencies for perl modules
by reading Makefile.PL or Build.PL and (sometimes) by reading the testscripts.

It is a list of modules in core perl-5.24.0 which are deps for modules I have
looked at.  Occasionally, a module might need a newer version than what is in
the current perl release.  Usually, that only affects modules used by
biblatex-biber.

The '::' translates to '/' when looking at a log of what got installed,
but some are slightly different (library, not pm ?) and some of the
modules are in the Arch-OS (x86_64-linux-thread-multi) directory.

If you see 'eval' in a Makefile.PL or in a test, it implies that the module
may be optional.  There are one or two exceptions in Makefile.PLs where a
module is only needed with certain versions of another module

This list is in alphabetical order, with digits and '::' after letters,
NOT ASCII order

Any reference to inc:: in the Makefile.PL means that a module used
during the build or install is shipped within the tarball.
