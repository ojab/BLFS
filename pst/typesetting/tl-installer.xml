    <title>Introduction to TeX Live and its installer</title>

    <para>
      The <application>TeX Live</application> package is a comprehensive
      TeX document production system.  It includes TeX, LaTeX2e, ConTeXt,
      Metafont, MetaPost, BibTeX and many other programs; an extensive
      collection of macros, fonts and documentation; and support for
      typesetting in many different scripts from around the world.
    </para>

    <para>
      This page is for people who wish to use the binary installer to
      provide the programs, the scripts, and a lot of supporting files and
      documentation.  The installer is updated frequently, so its md5sum will
      change if it is newer than what is shown below.  Newer versions of the
      installer are expected to work with these instructions, for so long as
      they install to a
      <filename class="directory">&texlive-year;/</filename> directory.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are two reasons why you may wish to install the binaries in BLFS:
      either you need a smaller install (e.g. at a minimum plain TeX without
      LaTeX2e, ConTeXt, etc), or you wish to use <command>tlmgr</command> to
      get updates whilst this version is supported (typically, until April of
      the year after it was released). For the latter, you might prefer to
      install in your <filename class="directory">/home</filename> directory
      as an unprivileged user, and to then make corresponding changes to the
      PATH in your <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> or equivalent.

        As always with contributed binary software, it is possible that the
        required dependencies may change when the installer is updated. In
        particular, these dependencies have only been checked on x86_64.

    <title>Binary Installation of TeX Live</title>

    <para>
      The <application>TeX Live</application> set of programs with its
      supporting documents, fonts, and utilities is very large.  The upstream
      maintainers recommend placing all files in a single directory structure.
      BLFS recommends <filename class='directory'>/opt/texlive</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      As with any other package, unpack the installer and change into its
      directory, <filename class='directory'>
        install-tl-&lt;CCYYMMDD&gt;</filename>.
      This directory name changes when the installer is updated, so replace
      &lt;CCYYMMDD&gt; by the correct directory name.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        The distribution binaries installed below may use static linking
        for general linux system libraries.  Additional libraries or
        interpreters as specified in the dependencies section do not need to
        be present during the install, but the programs that need them will
        not run until their specific dependencies have been installed.
      </para>

    <!-- please keep something like this in the future -->
      <para>
        With all contributed binary software, there may be a mismatch between
        the builder's toolchain and your hardware.  In most of TeX this will
        probably not matter, but in uncommon corner cases you might hit
        problems.  e.g. if your x86_64 processor does not support 3dnowext or
        3dnow, the 2014-06-28 binary failed in conTeXt when running LuaTeX,
        although lualatex worked, as did the i686 binaries on the same
        machine. In such cases, the easiest solution is to install texlive
        from source. Similarly, the x86_64 binary version of
        <command>asy</command> runs very slowly when creating 3-D diagrams.

      This command is interactive and allows selection or modification of
      platform, packages, directories, and other options. The full installation
      scheme will require about 4.9 gigabytes of disk space. The time to
      complete the download will depend on your internet connection speed
      and the number of packages selected.
