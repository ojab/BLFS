<title>Introduction</title>

<para>This chapter covers the things you need to do when you are using
Bugzilla for entering new bugs into the system, and fixing/updating
outstanding bugs.</para>

<para>It's assume you have already logged into Bugzilla before doing anything
outlined in the following sections.</para>

</section>

<section id="ch05-addingcomments">
<title>Adding comments</title>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Go to the bug you want to update.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Add your additional information in the
<emphasis>Additional Comments</emphasis> text field.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>As the last step, click on the <emphasis>Commit</emphasis>
button to commit your changes to the database. A log of this will be sent
to the blfs-book mailinglist.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</section>

<section id="ch05-filingbug">
<title>Enter a new bug</title>

<para>You found a bug, or somebody else found a bug and you decided to add
it to Bugzilla.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Go to <ulink url="&blfs-bugzilla;"/></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Select the proper <emphasis>Version</emphasis>. You most
always will choose the <emphasis>CVS</emphasis> version. (Note: SVN will be
added to the options.  Use that if you see it.) The other versions
are basically there only for people who don't edit the book
and who want to report a bug against the book version they
have.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Don't worry about <emphasis>Platform, OS, and Severity</emphasis>. 
Those aren't used at the moment.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Select the <emphasis>Priority</emphasis>. Use
your own judgement on how important fixing this bug is. If you're not sure
just leave the default. Priorities are periodically re-evaluated and
changed anyways (what may be P5 a month ago may be changed to a P1 now
because it's finally time to fix it).</para>

<para>Use the following guidelines:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>P1&mdash;Critical issue that prevents build a system 
       by the book and must be fixed as soon as possible. Includes package 
       updates that fix serious security holes or fix some other critical bug.</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>P2&mdash;Major issue but not critical in the sense you 
       cannot build an application with it. This includes most package updates. 
       Must be fixed before the next release.</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>P3&mdash;Minor issue that would be nice to have fixed 
       in the next release.</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>P4&mdash;Textual changes that have no impact on the 
       installation instructions.</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>P5&mdash;A new, unclassified and/or unconfirmed bug.</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</listitem>


<listitem><para>Select the <emphasis>Initial state</emphasis>. Only select
<emphasis>UNCONFIRMED</emphasis> if you haven't checked the matter out yet
and are only suspecting a bug. Otherwise, leave it as
<emphasis>NEW</emphasis></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you don't want to assign yourself to it right away,
leave the <emphasis>Assigned To</emphasis> field blank. It'll be assigned
to <emphasis>blfs-book@linuxfromscratch.org</emphasis> then, until a real
editor changes that to himself.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Fill in the other fields as appropriate,
<emphasis>Summary</emphasis> and <emphasis>Description</emphasis> are
mandatory.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>As the last step, click on the <emphasis>Commit</emphasis>
button to commit your changes to the database. A log of this will be sent
to the blfs-book mailinglist.</para></listitem>
