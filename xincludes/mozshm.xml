    <para>
      If you are compiling this package in chroot you must do two things.
      First, as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user,
      ensure that <filename>/dev/shm</filename> is mounted. If you do not
      do this, the <application>Python</application> configury will fail
      with a traceback report referencing
      <filename>/usr/lib/pythonN.N/multiprocessing/synchronize.py</filename>.
      Run:

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>mountpoint /dev/shm >/dev/null ||
 mount -t tmpfs devshm /dev/shm</userinput></screen>
